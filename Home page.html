            <center><div class="container">
                <p>My name is Bhawana Chitara and I'm passionate about improving the lives of others through design.<br>
                    I'm constantly learning new things everyday and love meeting people who are motivated and unafraid
                    of sharing their ideas with the world.<br><br>

                    I'm a self taught designer and have learnt a lot of the processes, concepts and theories of UX/UI and 
                  design through attending workshops, reading blogs and applying these to projects in my spare time and at work.

            <ul solid style="list-style-type: circle">
               <li><h3>Passion is Everything</h3></li>
                <p>If you don't enjoy what you're doing - move. You are not a tree. Channel your energy into something you believe
                    in. I'm fortunate to be inspired and surrounded by motivated people who enjoy what they do. We only have
                    so much time on this earth to live - so why waste it?</p>

               <li><h3>Always be Learning</h3></li>
               <p>Humans are constant works in progress that need to receive feedback in order to grow. I am always
                    looking at ways to challenge and improve myself, which is why in my spare time I like to participate
                     in h, read blogs, dabble in new projects and attend meetups.</p>

               <li><h3>Embrace your Creativity</h3></li>
               <p>Everyone needs a creative outlet of some sort - else, we'd go insane! When I'm not designing, I'm singing
                with the band, painting artworks as a form of meditation and helping startups realise their potential
                with design.</p>
